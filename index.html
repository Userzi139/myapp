  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Last updated: [DATE]</p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>[Your App Name]</strong> (“we”, “us”, or “our”) collects, uses, discloses, and stores information when you interact with our chatbot via Instagram direct messages (DMs) using n8n.
  </p>

  <h2>Data We Collect</h2>
  <p>Through the Instagram Messaging API and our chatbot, we may collect:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Message content (text, images, media) you send to us</li>
    <li>Your Instagram user ID (or recipient ID)</li>
    <li>Timestamps of messages</li>
    <li>Metadata such as message status (sent, delivered, read)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How We Use the Data</h2>
  <p>We use the collected data for the following purposes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>To respond to your messages and facilitate bot functionality</li>
    <li>To route the messages within our systems (n8n workflows, background tasks)</li>
    <li>To improve or debug the chatbot (e.g. logging errors, analytics)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Storage & Retention</h2>
  <p>
    We store your messages and associated metadata in our backend systems temporarily. We retain data only as long as necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected, unless a longer retention is required by law.
  </p>
  <p>
    After that period, we permanently delete or anonymize the data.
  </p>

  <h2>Sharing & Disclosure</h2>
  <p>
    We do not share your message content or personal data with third parties, except:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>When required by law, regulation, or court order</li>
    <li>To service providers or infrastructure partners who operate under confidentiality obligations (e.g., hosting, storage)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>
    We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your data from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. However, no system is completely immune to breach, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.
  </p>

  <h2>Your Rights</h2>
  <p>You have rights regarding your data, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Right to access: you can request a copy of your data</li>
    <li>Right to correction: you can ask to correct inaccurate data</li>
    <li>Right to deletion: you can ask us to delete your data</li>
    <li>Right to object or restrict processing</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    To exercise any of these rights, you can contact us at: <strong>[your contact email]</strong>.
